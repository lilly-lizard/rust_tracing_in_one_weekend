# Rust Tracing in One Weekend

A sketchy rust implementation of the the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" series by Peter Shirley which can be found at [raytracing.github.io](https://raytracing.github.io/).

The rust source for each of his three books can be found on **each branch** in this repo:

- **ray_tracing_in_one_weekend**
- **ray_tracing_the_next_week**
- **ray_tracing_the_rest_of_your_life**

_Note: I skipped some of the functionality in the third book that I wasn't interested in. This project was mainly an exercise for me to learn rust._
